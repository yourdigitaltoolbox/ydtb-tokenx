# YDTB Elementor TokenX 

`tokenx` is a command-line tool designed to simplify the process of copying and pasting Elementor sections while allowing you to make targeted changes to the JSON payload. Elementor, a popular WordPress page builder, generates large JSON payloads when copying widgets or sections. This tool enables you to adjust the copied data by tagging specific sections for replacement, making it easier to customize your designs without tediously changing repeatable sections. 

## Features

- **Efficient JSON Editing**: Modify the JSON payload generated by Elementor to make precise changes to copied widgets or sections.
- **Tag-Based Replacement**: Use tags to identify and replace specific sections/strings of the JSON payload.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Save time by automating making sections. 
- **Allow AI and ChatGPT to easily generate content in your sections**

## How It Works

1. **Copy an Elementor Widget or Section**: In Elementor, copy a widget or section. This action places a large JSON payload on your clipboard. Due to some limitations, I recommend installing Ultimate Elementor and using their UAE Copy.
2. **Run `tokenx`**: Use the tool to load the JSON payload and make adjustments by tagging sections you want to replace.
3. **Run `tokenx --generate`**: to generate the new json payload you can paste. 
3. **Paste the Modified JSON**: Paste the updated JSON back into Elementor to apply your changes. (Again using UAE Paste).

## Usage

`tokenx` provides several options to streamline your workflow:

### Options:
- `--rework`: Open tokenization UI for an existing template.
- `--generate`: Render template(s) with token values and copy to clipboard or print.
- `--template=name`: Specify a template folder name to rework or generate from.
- `--no-copy`: Skip copying to clipboard, print JSON output instead.
- `--remove`: Remove a template (prompt for selection).
- `--remove=name`: Remove a specific template by name.
- `-h, --help`: Show this help message.
